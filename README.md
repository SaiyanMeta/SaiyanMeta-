# SaiyanMeta Code of Conduct
This is The SaiyanMeta Bot code of conduct, make sure too follow these rules when using my discord bot.
1. Data that is stored within the bot is deleted with a range from 10-20 minutes. We have a secure data storing site that stores tons of used data.
2. Our bot is only used for anti nuke, moderation, and fun. if it is used for any other uneeded purpose, it will not be tolerated.
3. SaiyanMeta is a bot which is mostly on its own, you cant really ping the bot because it wont do anything.
4. Make sure that the use of SaiyanMeta is safe, and allowed, our bot is not made for the mental harm of those. do not use our bot too spam ping, or argue with others.
   this is all, make sure you make the use of our bor overall friendly and safe. thank you.
